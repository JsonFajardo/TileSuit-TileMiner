## Overview
Tile Miner is an R-based tool for generating checker-style tile plots from nucleotide sequences. Each sequence is fetched from NCBI using either an accession number or an Entrez query, and is visualized in a grid layout where each base is assigned a tile. Layout width and coloring affect the visual emergence of patterns, enabling exploration of sequence structure.

Version 1.1 introduces support for **coordinate slicing** (visualizing subregions of a sequence) and **user-defined color schemes**, allowing custom visual encoding strategies.

---

## Features
- Fetch nucleotide sequences by accession or search query.  
- Batch mode supports multiple sequence retrievals and layout generation.  
- Generates one `.png` plot per width per page.  
- Saves `.fasta` files for each sequence with gene names in the filename (if available).  
- Optional filters for sequence length.  
- Adjustable layout widths and pagination.  
- Supports sorting of search results.  
- **NEW**: Optional `start` and `end` parameters for slicing a specific region.  
- **NEW**: Customizable `color_scheme` argument for user-defined tile color encoding.  
- **NEW**: Per-sequence `.meta` files with metadata for downstream reuse.

## Usage

#### Single Accession Example

    tile_miner("NM_001101.5")


#### Batch Query Example

    tile_miner(
      query = "actin[Title] AND Homo sapiens[Organism] AND biomol_mrna[PROP]",
      widths = c(60, 80),
      max_results = 5,
      batch_size = 2,
      bases_per_page = 5000,
      min_length = 500,
      sort = "relevance"
    )


#### Other Examples

**Long RNA viral genome with multiple widths**
  
    tile_miner("NC_045512.2", widths = c(40, 60, 80), bases_per_page = 2000)

**Bacterial gene with genomic source and length limits**
  
    tile_miner("rpoB[Gene] AND Escherichia coli[Organism] AND biomol_genomic[PROP]", 
               widths = 70, max_results = 3, min_length = 5000)

**Intentional no-hit query to test error handling**

    tile_miner("unknown_gene[Gene] AND Homo sapiens[Organism]", max_results = 5)

**Slicing a genome region**

    tile_miner("NC_000913.3", start = 100000, end = 105000, widths = 50)

**Custom color scheme usage**

    tile_miner("NM_001101.5", widths = 60, color_scheme = c(A="#0000FF", T="#FF0000", G="#00FF00", C="#FFFF00"))

## Parameters
- `query`: Accession number or NCBI Entrez search string  
- `widths`: Integer vector; number of columns in each tile plot  
- `max_results`: Max number of results to retrieve (for search queries)  
- `batch_size`: Number of sequences to process per batch  
- `bases_per_page`: Number of bases per image page (controls pagination)  
- `save_fasta`: Save each sequence as a `.fasta` file (TRUE/FALSE)  
- `min_length`, `max_length`: Filter sequences by length (bp)  
- `verbose`: Print progress messages (TRUE/FALSE)  
- `sort`: Search result order (see below)  
- `start`, `end`: 1-based coordinates for region slicing (accession mode only)  
- `color_scheme`: Optional named vector mapping bases to hex color codes  

  -`sort` Options for `tile_fetch_batch()`

     - "relevance" (default)
     - "date"  
     - "submit_date"  
     - "sequence_length"  
     - "accn"  
     - "source"  

---

## Output
Each run creates a folder containing:  
- PNG images: One per width and page (e.g., NM_001101.5_w60_p1.png)  
- FASTA files: Named as Accession_Gene.fasta if gene metadata exists  
- `.meta` files: Per-sequence metadata stored in RDS format  
- `summary.txt` and `summary.csv`: Overview of plot settings and sources  

---

## NCBI Filter Grammar Cheatsheet
- `[Organism]`: Homo sapiens[Organism], Escherichia coli[Organism]  
- `[Gene]`: actin[Gene], p53[Gene]  
- `[Title]`: actin[Title] (less strict than `[Gene]`)  
- `[Sequence Length]`: 1000:3000[Sequence Length]  
- `[PDAT]`: 2020/01/01:2025/01/01[PDAT]  
- `[PROP]` Filters:  
  - `biomol_mrna[PROP]`: mRNA only  
  - `biomol_genomic[PROP]`: Genomic only  
  - `srcdb_refseq[PROP]`: RefSeq only  

You can combine filters using `AND`. Example:  

"p53[Gene] AND Homo sapiens[Organism] AND biomol_mrna[PROP]"

## Visualization Note
Tile plots are highly dependent on:  
- The layout width (columns)  
- The tile colouring scheme  

Structural properties of sequences may become visible or obscured depending on how the sequence is folded into a grid. Custom color schemes enable encoding of biological signals such as GC content or entropy.
