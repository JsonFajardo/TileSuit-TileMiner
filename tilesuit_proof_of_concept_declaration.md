TileSuit Proof of Concept Declaration

Project Title: TileSuit: A Visual Language for Genetic Sequences  
Date: June 15, 2015

## Overview

TileSuit is a visual representation system for nucleotide sequences that transforms raw genetic data into fixed-layout checker-style plots. Each sequence is converted into a visually distinct "tile plot," where the arrangement and shading of grid cells correspond to the sequence's base composition and layout parameters. The goal of TileSuit is to enable fast visual recognition, comparison, and exploration of sequences without requiring text-based parsing or alignment.

This declaration serves to publicly timestamp and assert the authorship of the TileSuit system, as originally conceived, designed, and directed by Jason Fajardo.

## Purpose

The primary aim of this proof of concept is to demonstrate the viability of tile plots as visual identity systems for genetic sequences. Each plot functions as a visual barcode or fingerprint, providing:

* Human-recognizable identity at a glance  
* Layout-sensitive structural patterns  
* Visual comparison without alignment  
* Exploratory potential for genomics, synthetic biology, and education

## Note on Layout Sensitivity

The visual pattern of a tile plot depends not only on the sequence itself, but also on the layout used to display it â€” especially the number of columns (i.e., how the sequence is wrapped into rows). As a result, the same sequence can appear very different depending on the chosen layout. This variability is not an artifact of the TileSuit system, but rather a property of the sequence itself: when arranged in different ways, some sequences reveal subtle forms of regularity or variation that may not be visible otherwise. TileSuit is designed to expose and explore this natural layout-dependent behaviour.

## Authorship and AI Assistance

All creative concepts, visual logic, use case design, and intent originated from Jason Fajardo. Parts of the technical implementation (including R code and documentation drafting) were developed with the assistance of OpenAI's ChatGPT, used strictly as a programming and ideation tool. ChatGPT is not a co-author; authorship, direction, and intellectual ownership reside solely with the human creator.
